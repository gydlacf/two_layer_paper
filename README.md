The repository of data for the paper titled _A
kinetic transition network model reveals the diversity of protein
dimer formation mechanisms_.

There are two folders in the repository, one containing the
description of the states (/states) and another containing the
description of the transition matrices. 

The file names follows the {pdbid}_{dissociation entropy} pattern. For
example, 1arr_87.0 contains the data for the 1arr PDB structure
calculated at $$87\ \mathrm{\frac{J}{mol \cdot K}$$.
